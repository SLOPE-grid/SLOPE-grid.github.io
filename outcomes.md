# Highlights of project output   

## Power grid short-term response to wildfires (Aug 2025)
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/wildfires/four_wildfires_pic.png" alt="4 concurent California wildfires">
We developed capabilities that intersect wildfire paths (both realtime probabilistic forecasts and historical data) with power grids. This allows  detecting grid components that may be affected by wildfire and building a list of N-k contingencies. Nonlinear  N-k security-constrained ACOPF models are used to optimally and safely position the grid with respect to this contingencies. Test cases using California test system and California wildfires are available <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wildfires/">here</a>.

## Release of <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/exajugo">ExaJuGO</a>: a Julia library for SC-ACOPF (Apr 2025)

## Release (beta) of <a href="https://github.com/SLOPE-grid/tsSLOPE">tsSLOPE</a> (Mar 2025)
tsSLOPE contains glue code for integrating learning models for transient stability into ExaJuGO's (static) ACOPF models.
