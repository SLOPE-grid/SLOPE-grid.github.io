# <span style="color: ;">Scalable Learning and Optimization for Secure and Economic Grid Operations</span>


Secure and economic operation of the U.S. power grid with high levels of variable renewable energy poses a major challenge to grid operators and is a bottleneck towards the nation’s commitment to 100% clean electricity. Power demand and supply are increasingly volatile with the surge of renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind farms, and new types of loads such as electrical vehicles, which have put the stability and security of operating the power grid at an inflection point. Grid contingencies, which include transmission failures, generation outages, and adversarial threats, pose additional security risks and are also more pervasive due to more frequent extreme weather events. Balancing economics and security has shifted from challenging to intractable for the current state of the art due to the need to consider high- fidelity stability simulations, complex contingency assessment, and a large number of what-if contingency scenarios simultaneously in the grid’s operational control loop.


To address this challenge, this project introduces a series of mathematical, computational, and modeling advancements that will significantly reduce the computational footprint of operational power grid control loops. To this end, we will develop physics-informed machine learning algorithms equipped with trustwor- thy statistical models to capture stability risks, effectively circumventing the need for intractable stability simulations within the control loop itself. Risk-averse mathematical optimization algorithms will be de- veloped to robustly treat the stability risks together with the risks due to contingencies while ensuring cost efficiency and safe electricity flows for geographically large and highly complex U.S. power grid systems. Our work will culminate in a streamlined high-performance computing (HPC) framework that will provide an end-to-end software solution for how modern HPC, including DOE leadership computing, can be used not only to ensure efficient and secure operation but also to assess the impact of climate change and security threats on the nation’s power grid.

In the evolving landscape of smart grid technology, machine learning algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for optimizing power distribution networks. These sophisticated systems leverage deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to predict load demands, manage distributed energy resources, and dynamically adjust power flow parameters in real-time. By analyzing vast streams of sensor data from smart meters, weather stations, and grid infrastructure components, these AI systems can identify patterns and anomalies that would be impossible for human operators to detect. The integration of renewable energy sources, with their inherent variability, has made these predictive capabilities particularly crucial for maintaining grid stability and efficiency.

The challenge of uncertainty quantification in power grid optimization remains at the forefront of research efforts in this domain. Engineers and data scientists employ advanced statistical methods, including Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to characterize the uncertainty in their predictions and control decisions. These uncertainty-aware approaches are essential for robust decision-making in the face of multiple sources of variability, from renewable generation forecasts to consumer demand patterns. By explicitly modeling and propagating uncertainties through their algorithms, grid operators can make more informed decisions about resource allocation, maintenance scheduling, and emergency response planning. This probabilistic framework has proven particularly valuable in preventing cascading failures and optimizing grid resilience during extreme weather events, marking a significant advancement in the field of power systems engineering.
