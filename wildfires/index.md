# Wildfire impact on power grids - California test cases

We intersect wildfire paths (both realtime probabilistic forecasts and historical data) with power grids and build contigencies: which grid  components (lines, transformers, generators, and loads) are inoperable due to to the wildfire. These are known as N-k contingencies and generally the number k of grid elements inoperable is quite large. Nonlinear  N-k security-constrained ACOPF models are used to optimally and safely position the grid with respect to this contingencies. Test cases are using California test system (CATS) and California wildfire path predictions and historical data.
