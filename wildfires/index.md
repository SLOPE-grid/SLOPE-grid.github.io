# Wildfire impact on power grids - California test cases

We intersect wildfire paths (both realtime probabilistic forecasts and historical data) with power grids and build contigencies: which grid  components (lines, transformers, generators, and loads) are inoperable due to to the wildfire. These are known as N-k contingencies and generally the number k of grid elements inoperable is quite large. Nonlinear  N-k security-constrained ACOPF models are used to optimally and safely position the grid with respect to this contingencies. Test cases are using California test system (CATS) and California wildfire path predictions and historical data.

## Monument wildfire
The Monument wildfire occurred west of Big Bar in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Trinity County. This fire ignited on July 30, 2021, and was contained on October 27, 2021, ultimately burning 223,124 acres.

For our simulation, we used historical wildfire data to model potential impacts on electrical infrastructure. From this data, we needed to define a threat bufferâ€”the zone within which the wildfire could potentially affect electrical equipment. Within this designated zone, all power lines, transformers, and generators must be shut down as a safety precaution. Given that this fire occurred during summer conditions in a forested area, we established a threat buffer extending 12 miles from the fire perimeter.

Based on this 12-mile buffer zone, our analysis identified that 25 power lines, 4 transformers, and 1 generator would need to be deactivated during the fire event.

SD: 6
Number of off lines: 16
Number of off transformers: 3
Number of off generator buses: 0

SD: 2
Number of off lines: 4
Number of off transformers: 0
Number of off generator buses: 0

## Eaton fire
The Eaton wildfire occurred in Los Angeles County, Southern California. The fire began on January 7, 2025, and was contained on January 31, 2025, ultimately burning 14,021 acres. This was one of several major fires occurring simultaneously in the region.

For our simulation, we used probabilistic forecasted data to model the potential impacts on electrical infrastructure. Given the urban setting of this fire, we established a threat buffer extending only 2 miles from the fire perimeter, as the urban environment reduces the likelihood of fire spread compared to forested areas.

Based on this 2-mile buffer zone, our analysis identified that 92 power lines, 4 transformers, and 13 generators would need to be deactivated during the fire event.

## Stress test - multiple wilfires
For the stress test, we ran our simulation with multiple wildfires occurring simultaneously. We collected data from the major wildfires that occurred in Southern California during January 2025. For this test, we obtained historical wildfire data for the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth, and Hurst wildfires. Each fire was assigned the same buffer zone of 2 miles, reflecting the urban environment common to all these fire locations.

Based on these 2-mile buffer zones, our analysis identified that 97 power lines, 7 transformers, and 14 generators would need to be deactivated during the concurrent fire events. The deactivation of these power lines and transformers created four separate electrical islands within the grid system.
